## 2. Current Objective

Phase 17 is complete. Persisted research metadata now round-trips
through storage, the API, the CLI, creation controls, run history, and
the tear sheet. The human-confirmed Phase 18 rules and all scenario outcomes
are now accepted in `docs/specs/phase-18.md` under `phase18-temporal-v1`.
Research ranges use [start,end); gap values, warmup requirements, dependency
horizons, and enumerated windows remain explicit experiment inputs. No global
numeric defaults may be invented. Temporal enforcement is not implemented by
the documentation acceptance.

Older per-task evidence blocks (12.1 through 16.5.5), the stray Phase
12.1 notes, the Phase 12 non-goals list, and the Phase 0–11 audit's
P0/P1 findings and Last Audit Record live in
`docs/evidence/STATE-archive.md`. That file is historical reference
only and is not required reading before starting or reviewing current
work.

### Current task

**18.2k — Transactional selection and observation-access barrier** — READY.
18.2j is accepted for durable synthetic source and candidate capture only.
The standalone readiness contract below opens only the existing-store selection,
validation/OOS observation release and external-inspection extension. It does
not implement those barriers. Remaining 18.2 is NOT_STARTED as a whole;
evaluation reservations/results and runtime integration remain deferred.
next_task null, last_completed_task 18.2j, Phase18 IN_PROGRESS.

### Phase 17 tasks

- [x] **17.1 — Research metadata persistence contract** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.2 — Research metadata API schemas** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.3 — Research metadata API transport** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.4 — Backtest CLI research metadata inputs** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.5 — Frontend research metadata wire types** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.6 — Research metadata creation controls** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.7 — Research-aware run history** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.8 — Tear-sheet research identity display** — COMPLETE

### Phase 18 tasks

- [x] **18.1 — IS/validation/OOS semantics questions** — COMPLETE. Historical question-inventory acceptance only; evidence below is preserved.
- [x] **18.1.1 — Confirmed temporal decision record** — COMPLETE. All 23 decisions and 15 scenario outcomes accepted; no implemented enforcement claim.
- [ ] **18.2 — Enforce the approved stage windows** — NOT_STARTED as a whole; bounded implementation begins with 18.2a only and requires later accepted integration work.
- [x] **18.2a — Pure research-range declaration helper and test** — COMPLETE. Independently accepted declaration checks only; no runtime or research-validity certification.
- [x] **18.2b — Verified bar-clock and coverage helper and test** — COMPLETE. Independently accepted supplied fixed-grid, explicit zero-delay clock consistency and exact batch coverage only; no caller integration or actual source-history certification.
- [x] **18.2c — RunCreate raw research declaration admission** — COMPLETE. Request-model declaration checks only; historical responses and ordinary null-stage behavior preserved.
- [x] **18.2d — CLI research declaration admission** — COMPLETE. Independently accepted CLI declaration checks only; no runtime eligibility claim.
- [x] **18.2e — Runtime raw declaration recheck** — COMPLETE. Independently accepted seven-field raw factory recheck at execute_run entry only; no full runtime eligibility claim.
- [x] **18.2f — Minimal Stage 1 research runtime probe** — COMPLETE. Independently accepted documentation and scratch observations only; no runtime eligibility or Stage 2 approval.
- [x] **18.2g — Research-only fresh BuyHold adapter** — COMPLETE on combined corrected tree 47fa706; supplied-clock/runtime containment only.
- [x] **18.2g.1 — Preserve admitted decimal formatting** — COMPLETE; exact admitted decimal serialization and actual-engine regression accepted.
- [x] **18.2h — Immutable raw research input snapshot and exact identity** — COMPLETE; supplied evidence/content identity only.
- [x] **18.2i — Reproduce and bind controlled fixture inputs** — COMPLETE; deterministic synthetic recipe reproduction only, no historical source certification or runtime integration.
- [x] **18.2j — Append-only source and frozen candidate capture store** — COMPLETE; durable capture only, no selection/inspection barrier or runtime integration.
- [ ] **18.2k — Transactional selection and observation-access barrier** — READY; existing-store extension only under the standalone contract below; evaluation reservation/completion/results and runtime integration deferred.
- [ ] **18.3 — Embargo and gap rules** — NOT_STARTED. Only EG-01's named transitions, with EG-02/EG-03 evidence and exclusions, after preceding acceptance/readiness gates.
- [ ] **18.4 — Walk-forward window identity** — NOT_STARTED. Only WF-01's explicitly enumerated model and WF-02–WF-04 rules, after preceding acceptance/readiness gates.

### U.6 tasks

- [x] **U.6.1 — Risk tab component** — COMPLETE
- [x] **U.6.2 — Risk route and eight-item navigation** — COMPLETE
- [x] **U.6.3 — Overview KPI and chart cleanup** — COMPLETE
- [x] **U.6.4 — Performance cleanup and Risk chart ownership** — COMPLETE
- [x] **U.6.5 — Data experiment identity and UTC range** — COMPLETE

### Phase 16.5 tasks

- [x] **16.5.1 — Experiment identity header** — COMPLETE
- [x] **16.5.2 — Overview executive summary** — COMPLETE. Headline and secondary KPIs visible together, plus existing equity, drawdown, and monthly heatmap. No new metrics. No rolling series.
- [x] **16.5.3 — Performance investigation layout** — COMPLETE. Existing price, equity, and underwater charts, equity dominant. No rolling Sharpe or volatility unless a series already exists on the tear sheet.
- [x] **16.5.4 — Trades summary** — COMPLETE. Existing closed-trade KPIs above the current ledger. No MAE, MFE, or R-multiple charts.
- [x] **16.5.5 — Data methodology layout** — COMPLETE. Reorganize fields the Data tab already renders, including the recorded equity clock. No new identity fields.
- [x] **16.5.6 — Honest unavailable sections** — COMPLETE. Regimes and Robustness stay empty of fabricated analysis. Execution shows assumptions already on the response, not a cost breakdown.

Record an accepted task in this file only after the reviewer re-runs that task's acceptance commands. Do not open the next task until that evidence block is committed.

### Recorded explicit post-probe human approval

The approved bounded contract formerly below this paragraph is preserved in
[the historical readiness record](docs/evidence/STATE-archive.md#182g-readiness-contract-and-post-probe-approval).

**Human approval (2026-10-03):** after the accepted 18.2f probe and exact
bounded Stage 2 proposal were presented, the user replied directly:
"make trustworthy decisions and continue until this phase is done".
The coordinator and independent readiness reviewer record this as explicit
post-probe WORKFLOW §2 approval of the observed calls
`engine.cache.positions_open()` and
`engine.cache.positions_open(instrument_id=InstrumentId.from_str('BTCUSDT.BINANCE'))`,
and the bounded research-only BuyHold implementation below. It clears the
current human-transition gate. It approves no unseen future probe, unfamiliar
API, new dependency, automatic phase crossing or completed implementation.
Earlier 18.2f readiness/completion evidence remains historical and unchanged.

### Completed historical evidence references

Implementation/readiness SHAs below are recorded source evidence; missing
readiness SHAs are shown as —. Separate historical reviewer completion commits

### 18.2j independent readiness contract — 2026-10-04 Asia/Manila

Independent readiness opens ONLY **18.2j READY**. Baseline clean branch
`phase18/18.2j-research-capture`, HEAD/refreshed main
`7011059bc50591635fb1f26ab176a7b0ca07e54c`. Independent `git ls-remote origin
refs/heads/main` returned that same SHA with the default sandbox and enabled
network. Coordinator verified PR12 merge after all three checks SUCCESS and
empty reviews/threads. Source implementation
`d7f5edc5f5fcb0fbd00e77347321b21d05259f72` and independent acceptance
`6ba8c10694a9733d756376f094446e4437a27687` are ancestors of HEAD (both exit 0);
tracked tree equals the accepted tree (`git diff --quiet 6ba8c10 HEAD`, exit 0).
Those original source SHAs remain evidence; the merge does not replace them.

Read full live STATE/AGENTS/WORKFLOW/REVIEWER/INCIDENTS in bounded chunks;
PROJECT stack, database contracts, execution, conventions, Phases16–18,
completion and AI rules; full confirmed Phase18 spec; project/backend rules;
accepted fixture binder, input canonical identity, coverage and runner parameter
contracts; existing stdlib SQLite connection/schema pattern. No unfamiliar
third-party calls or new dependency; no probe is required. Delegated trustworthy
routine decisions authorize the conservative supported contract below.
This standalone STATE contract governs implementation, not the disposable plan.
Original post-probe approval, full 18.2i readiness/completion and all history and
rules are preserved. No archive maintenance is part of this readiness task.

## Scope decision

Do NOT bundle first source capture, candidate contract, final selection, inspection admission and evaluation reservation state machine into one initial task. They require different acceptance invariants and would exceed a narrow reviewable store task. 18.2j creates usable durable source+candidate capture with actual DB ordering, not another unused pure helper. Immediately dependent18.2k extends THE SAME store with atomic selection/holdout inspection/reservation barrier before any runtime/API access integration.18.2j cannot claim OOS prevention; no frozenboolean substituted for authorization. No automatic nextREADY or wholephaseclaim.

ONLY new backend/src/quant/data/research_store.py and backend/tests/data/test_research_store.py. stdlibSQLite/json/hashlib/time + accepted fixture/input/temporal imports, no dependencies/probes. No meta_runs/schema/router/worker/runtime/UI changes. Single metadataSQLite database path supplied by caller, dedicated research_events_v1 table in that database, no separateDB singleton. Shared meta_runs integration later.

#### Public internal interface

Frozen slots StoredResearchEvent(seq:int, event_id:str, kind:Literal['input','candidate'], recorded_at_ts:int, canonical_bytes:bytes). Direct construction unvalidated, noeligibleflag.
init_research_schema(db_path:Path)->None
capture_fixture_input(db_path:Path, *, recipe:Mapping[str,object], document:Mapping[str,object])->StoredResearchEvent
freeze_research_candidate(db_path:Path, *, document:Mapping[str,object])->StoredResearchEvent
_read_research_event(db_path:Path, *, event_id:str)->StoredResearchEvent | None (PRIVATE helper; no public raw-source getter)

Private read is INTERNAL persistence replay only, not an exported researcher observation/API endpoint. Public capture returns internal persistence records for future guarded adapters; those records must not be serialized as unlogged API input dumps. Future external input/result access must go through18.2k transactionalinspection gateway; directDB access cannot be independently certified. Internal module does not infer researchers have inspected just by engine/privatevalidation reads. Docs say no publicrawobservationread path currentlyintegrated.

#### Input capture, canonical persistence

Every input capture CALLS bind_controlled_fixture(rawrecipe,rawdocument), never trusts suppliedrecords/hashes. Persist full accepted snapshot.canonical_bytes plus recipe's exacttypedhex canonicaldocument (samei convention) inside canonical inputeventpayload containing exactfields contract_version='research-store-input-v1',recipe,snapshot. Here recipe/snapshot are canonicaltyped JSON values decoded viajson.loads from independentlyvalidatedbyte representations; snapshot contains fullrawrowcontent typedhex, source/revision/provenance.

Inputevent canonical json.dumps(sort_keysTrue,separators(',',':'),ensure_asciiFalse,allow_nanFalse).encodeUTF8 noBOM/newline; event_id='sha256:'+SHA256(payload). Exactsnapshot_id reconstructible fromnested snapshotcanonicalbytes; store verifies reproduction every capture AND upon reading an inputevent (decode typedhex into rawrecipe/document then acceptedbinder). No referencefetch/newverifier. Meaningful local decoder exact declaredshapes/kinds; unknown tags reject, no broadfallback.

Candidate uniqueness separatecolumns experiment_id,hypothesis_id,candidate_revision nullableforinput; UNIQUE(experiment_id,hypothesis_id,candidate_revision). No otherfuturetablefamilies now. The fixed kindCHECK remains input/candidate. Future18.2k lifecycle operations use a separate append-only lifecycle table with its own serverorder, explicitly referencing source/candidateevent IDs; no attempt to ALTER this CHECK or silently repurpose kinds. A transaction covers both tables when enforcing the futurebarrier; capture seq and lifecycle seq are distinct domains, never compared as globalorder. Candidate existence under the same BEGINIMMEDIATE transaction proves prior committedfreeze. Add BEFOREUPDATE/BEFOREDELETE triggers RAISE(ABORT,'research events are append-only'); noUPDATE/upsert/REPLACE inpubliccode. This prevents applicationaccidentalmutation, not malicious directSQLiteowner edits. Actual payload+digest+kindverified whenreading.

#### Errors/tests

Ownvalidation errors oneERRORquant.data.research_store plusidenticalValueError; acceptedbinder/coverageerrors propagateonceunwrapped. Private missingread returnsNone. No arbitrarypayloadinerrors; any SQLiteoperationalfailure propagatesoriginal without silentadaptation.

Exact candidate failureorder/messages:
1. CandidateMapping/exacttopkeys: `candidate must contain exactly the declared fields`.
2. contract_version,rule_id,strategy exacttokens in thatorder: `<field> must be <token>`.
3. experiment_id,hypothesis_id,candidate_revision,strategy_version,in_sample_input_id text in thatorder: `<field> must be a nonempty UTF-8 string without NUL` (surrogatesreject). parent_candidate_id: None or sametexttype with `parent_candidate_id must be null or a nonempty UTF-8 string without NUL`. code_id then requires str/fullmatch `[0-9a-f]{40}`: `code_id must be a 40-character lowercase hexadecimal git commit ID`. This is a callerassertedcodebinding, neverauthentication; runtimecomparesactualcode.
4. parametersexactkeys/Mapping: `parameters must contain exactly the declared fields`. Cash type/finite/positive/whole: `parameters.starting_balance_usdt must be a finite positive whole-USDT float`. Do not roundcash. Decimal lexical validation in trade_size,deploy_pct,maker_fee,taker_fee order: `parameters.<field> must be a finite decimal string` (strrequired, DecimalInvalidOperation/nonfinite rejected). For eachvalue immediately check constraints: `parameters.trade_size must be positive and exactly representable at 6 decimal places`; `parameters.deploy_pct must be between zero and one`; `parameters.maker_fee must be nonnegative`; `parameters.taker_fee must be nonnegative`. Use runner-equivalent contextfree digit/exponent/trailingzero representability: accepts size'1' and harmless extra zeroes, preserves originallexemes; no stricter inputformat imposed.
5. seedmustNone and fitted_artifacts emptylist/tuple: `seed and fitted_artifacts must be explicitly absent for buy_hold`. Emptycontainers canonicalize to JSONemptylist, declared applicabilityabsence ratherthanmodeltrust.
6. in_sample_start_ts,end_ts types in order: `<field> must be an integer excluding bool`. start<end: `in_sample_start_ts must be less than in_sample_end_ts`. trial_index/count types in order sameintegererror; count>0: `trial_count must be positive`; index1..count: `trial_index must be between one and trial_count`.
7. BEGINIMMEDIATE resolves input first: missing/wrongkind -> `candidate input event does not exist`. Sourceintegrity/binderfailures propagate existingvalidationonce. Check ISstart thenend congruence to capturedanchor: `in_sample_start_ts must align with the declared daily grid`; `in_sample_end_ts must align with the declared daily grid`. Select exact ISclosemembers and call acceptedcoveragehelper; completecount/empty/rowerrors use its exactmessages, no relog. Later/contextrows retained in sourcepayload but not allowedselectionmembership.
8. Optionalparent then resolves: missing/wrongkind -> `parent candidate event does not exist`; presentdifferentexperiment/hypothesis -> `parent candidate does not match experiment and hypothesis`. Then candidate_revisionuniqueness: samecanonicalid returns originalevent, changedcontent under sameexperiment/hypothesis/revision -> `candidate revision already has different frozen content`.
9. Persist/replay malformedencoding/digest/kind -> `stored research event failed integrity validation`. Validlyencodedstoredsource/candidate revalidation that fails acceptedfactory/helper propagates that firsterroronce; do not log integritywrapper in addition. No handwaving unspecified messages atreadiness.

Immediatelynext storeextension adds a separate append-only lifecycle table (source kindCHECK unchanged) and MUST enforce: enumerateconsideredtrials and exactselectioncriteria/selectiondataidentity; candidatefrozen beforeANYvalidationaccess; finalselectionfrozen beforeANYholdoutobservations/resultsaccess. Register exactholdout identity(boundactualsourcekeys/range, preventrenamedoverlap escape), record manualinspection declaredtime separately fromserverseq. BEGINIMMEDIATE serialization for finalselectionfreeze vsinspection/evaluationreservation, inspectionofsame/overlappingactualobservations blocks laterselection/revision usingthatuntouchedholdout; requiresnewunseenholdout. Exactrerun distinctreservation/resultpreserved, markedreproducibilitynotindependent. No finalselection authorization until this extension accepted. Then gateway/API/CLI/worker bindactualcandidateparams/code+fixture at runtime and every publicresult/inputread logsinspectiontransaction.18.2j completion certifiesdurablecapture only; no actualOOSbarrier yet, no implicitphasecompletion.

Synthetic recipe generation is predictable to its author. Neither candidate capture nor the later inspection barrier certifies an unseen market holdout, secret data, independent evidence or absence of external inspection. Supported claims stay reproducible synthetic contents and software temporal/access mechanics, separately from researcher declarations. Later holdout contamination keys must bind actual source/revision lineage and observation membership, including overlaps across renamed snapshots/revisions; a new hash alone cannot erase inspection.


#### Explicit integrity and transaction refinements

Every persisted input row must have null experiment_id, hypothesis_id and
candidate_revision columns. Every candidate row must have those three columns
exactly equal to the corresponding decoded canonical payload fields. Read and
reference replay checks this as part of integrity validation before trusting the
uniqueness index. A payload digest alone cannot certify those indexed columns.
Tests tamper an indexed column as well as payload/digest/kind.

Canonical JSON parsing and exact re-encoding must reproduce persisted bytes;
duplicate keys, noncanonical JSON and noncanonical typed-hex spellings fail with
`stored research event failed integrity validation`. Decode integers using
`int(value, 16)` and floats using `float.fromhex(value)`, only at the exact
contract numeric positions and with exact kind/value shapes. Re-encode using
`hex(integer)` / `float.hex()`; unknown tags or wrong numeric kinds fail, with
no decimal conversion limit, coercion or global setting change. Semantic
accepted binder/coverage failures still propagate once unchanged. Candidate
replay rebuilds the exact validated canonical payload and verifies equality;
empty fitted-artifact tuples canonicalize to JSON lists as declared above.

All reference lookup, integrity replay, uniqueness resolution and insertion
inside a mutation use that same connection and BEGIN IMMEDIATE transaction.
An internal connection-taking replay helper is permitted. Do not call the
path-taking private read helper from inside a write transaction or open another
connection for reference validation. Read replay detects recursive candidate
lineage cycles and fails integrity validation; accepted parent references must
resolve to earlier committed candidates, not newly fabricated self/cyclic links.
No digest/trigger/sequence/timestamp mechanism authenticates a malicious direct
SQLite owner. Server sequence proves application commit order only.

Readiness changed STATE only. No Python files changed; pytest/ruff/mypy were
not rerun under WORKFLOW §5. No implementation, suites, installs, workers,
push, merge or automatic next readiness. last_completed_task remains18.2i;
remaining18.2 NOT_STARTED, 18.3/18.4 NOT_STARTED, next_task null,
human_transition_required false and Phase18 IN_PROGRESS. Never begin Phase29.

### 18.2k independent readiness contract — 2026-10-04 Asia/Manila

Independent readiness opens ONLY **18.2k READY**. Verified clean branch
`phase18/18.2k-observation-barrier`, baseline HEAD/refreshed main
`628f836bb9967500b0481e9cbedef29b6f41b0d9`. Independent `git ls-remote origin
refs/heads/main` under use_default returned that exact SHA; this is point-in-time
remote evidence, not a future freshness claim. HEAD has exactly one parent,
`a4d677ca4bd4447f6f1d24ee1261e227d844d517`. The user `colossalshub` squash-merged
PR13 at 2026-10-03 18:23:30 UTC; the coordinator did not merge. `git diff --quiet
c279bc2d7686dfa10bcdad5dc38e2c86385022b5 HEAD` exit 0 establishes the accepted
integration tree is preserved, including the user's `.gitignore` change.
Original source `a61fdc9e6841573daa14448509bcddfe93a09411` and reviewer completion
`132d5f34863eacb93ed78ebbfb5ebf796183fb38` are historical evidence on the preserved
published branch/PR, NOT ancestors of this squash HEAD (both ancestry checks
exit 1). No normal-merge or all-checks-SUCCESS claim is made. The neutral Bugbot
nonfinite-float OverflowError finding was disproved by eight actual SQLite
replays: expected ValueError and one ERROR each; resolved thread and PR body
contain the proof. Raw `/tmp/phase18j-bugbot-review-replay.log` and probe remain
supporting session evidence, not a prerequisite artifact for implementation.

Read full live AGENTS/STATE/WORKFLOW/REVIEWER/INCIDENTS, relevant PROJECT stack,
SQLite/research contracts, execution/conventions, Phases16–18, completion and AI
rules; full confirmed Phase18 spec, project/backend rules, existing store/test,
fixture/input membership and accepted coverage contracts. Same stdlib SQLite
connection pattern, json/hashlib/time plus uuid4, no unfamiliar third-party
calls or dependencies; no probe required. Human delegated trustworthy routine
choices and continuation authorize this conservative refinement. All previous
approval, rules and j readiness/completion records remain byte-preserved.

This contract governs implementation, superseding disposable planning notes and
narrowing the historical j next-extension reservation/result language: ONLY
selection and observation-access logging now; separately gated evaluation
reservation/completion/result publication afterward, then runtime/API/CLI/worker
binding and guarded public access. The lifecycle table is private schema support
inside the existing store connection, not a separate migration/orchestration
project. One existing implementation file plus its mirrored test is the bounded
reviewable deliverable. No archive maintenance or implementation in readiness.

## Bounded usable scope

Implement actual store operations that atomically freeze selection and log observation release BEFORE returning data. Separate later task handles evaluation reservation/completion and guarded result publication: do not invent completed results or certify evaluation from an input access event. Each repeated observation release gets a distinct access event, marked repeat access, never independent evidence. Runtime/API integration must use these operations later; no integrated OOS guarantee claimed now. No new public unloggedrawgetter.

## New public internal APIs

Frozen slots ResearchLifecycleEvent(seq:int,event_id:str,kind:Literal['selection','inspection'],recorded_at_ts:int,canonical_bytes:bytes); ResearchObservationAccess(event:ResearchLifecycleEvent,observations:tuple[ResearchObservation,...]). Direct construction unvalidated; noeligibleflag.
freeze_final_selection(db_path:Path, *, document:Mapping[str,object])->ResearchLifecycleEvent
access_validation_observations(db_path:Path, *, candidate_id:str,input_id:str,start_ts:int,end_ts:int,actor:str)->ResearchObservationAccess
access_oos_observations(db_path:Path, *, selection_id:str,actor:str)->ResearchObservationAccess
record_external_inspection(db_path:Path, *, input_id:str,start_ts:int,end_ts:int,actor:str,declared_at_ts:int | None,note:str)->ResearchLifecycleEvent

Every returnedtuple contains ONLY explicitly requested halfopenclosemembers, never fullsnapshot/recipe/selectiondata. Publiccapture records j remain internal and MUSTNOT be blindly serialized by futureAPI. Privateconnectionreplay used inside samewritetransaction; no pathreplaynestedconnection. No publiclifecycle rawpayloadread added.

## Storage/order/identity

New research_lifecycle_v1 table(seq INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,event_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,kind TEXT CHECKkindselection/inspection,recorded_at_ts INTEGER NOT NULL,payload BLOB NOT NULL,selection_revision TEXT,experiment_id TEXT,hypothesis_id TEXT), UNIQUE(experiment_id,hypothesis_id,selection_revision); nullindexedfields forinspections. UPDATE/DELETEtriggers sameappend-onlypattern. Sourceevents unchanged. Everylifecyclemutation BEGINIMMEDIATE, replaysource/candidate/lifecycleintegrity, performchecks, append,COMMIT before returning observations; failureROLLBACK no release. Sameconnection bothtables.

Lifecycle serverseq authoritative for lifecycleordering; sourceeventseq distinctdomain. Every inspection records source_watermark=MAX(research_events_v1.seq) in same transaction. Thus candidate.seq<=inspection.source_watermark proves candidate alreadycommitted at release/manualreport; do not compare independentseqdomains or walltimes. Wallrecorded_at=time.time_ns//1000000 canrollback/repeat, never callerbackdated. Manualdeclaredtime is an attributed claim stored separately; cannot undo contamination or establishactualinspectiontime.

Canonical sortedcompactUTF8JSON, acceptedtypedhexALLnumbers, noBOM/newline, eventidSHA256prefix. Selectioncontentid deterministic/idempotent exactrecapture preservingoriginalseq even after laterinspection; NEW selectionrevision cannot use inspectedholdout. Each inspection payload includes server-generateduuid4.hex access_id so everycall distincteventid, action validation/oos/external, actor, declared_at_ts (nullforsoftwareaccess), note(nullforsoftwareaccess), input_id,bounds,source_watermark, subject membership, candidate_id/selection_id applicable elseNone. Fixed contractversions research-selection-v1/research-inspection-v1 andrulephase18-temporal-v1. Typedreplay verifiesdigest/canonicalencoding/indexedcolumns/references/subjectmembership; malformedpersistentdatafailintegrity, no hashtrustshortcut. Existing j decode/replay semantics preserved.

## Exact final selection document

Requiredkeys ONLY contract_version,rule_id,experiment_id,hypothesis_id,selection_revision,selected_candidate_id,considered_candidate_ids,selection_criteria,validation,input_id,oos_start_ts,oos_end_ts. selection_criteria explicitnonemptytext (criteriaidentity/recipe declaration, not inferred frombestmetric). IDs/textvalidUTF8/noNUL/surrogates,nounrequestedtrim. considered_candidate_ids nonemptylist/tupleuniqueIDs; orderretained. validation explicitNone OR exact {input_id,start_ts,end_ts}; this one commonrange is permitteddevelopmentvalidation for all consideredcandidates. input_id is finalholdoutcapturedsourceevent; oosbounds integerexcludingbool,start<end,gridaligned, actualexactcoverage. No globalnumericdefault/gap/window inferred.

All consideredids replay validfrozencandidates fromsameexperiment/hypothesis; selectedid occurslist. Each declares sametrial_count N==listlength, trial_indexexactset1..N; binds exact immutable parameters/code/seed/artifacts/ISinput/ranges via candidateids, not duplicatecaller overrides. Existing assertions retained; runtime later verifies actualexecutingcode/params exactly. No optimizerallowed. Complete selectiondata identity consists eachcandidateISinput+ISbounds and optionalcommonvalidationinput+bounds; actualmembertuples derived/persisted, not callerhash. If validationused, require everycandidate previouslypassed access_validation_observations on exactlythatinput/range, committedbeforeselection; require candidate existed before ANY earlier inspection of thatvalidationmembership (usinginspection watermark). If skippedNone require no validationaccess forconsideredcandidates (explicitskip, not ambiguoushiddenuse).

IS precedes validation ifpresent; validation precedesOOS else everyIS precedesOOS. Touchingendpoints allowed withoutgapguarantee. Every selectionIS/commonvalidation membership disjoint finalOOS membership; noholdoutobservationsallowedselection even ifinputIDrenamed. Any priorinspection of finalOOSsubject membership (software/manual, anyactor/experiment) prevents NEWselectionfreeze. Existingexactselectionrecapture idempotent, doesnot permit alteredfreeze afterinspection. Exactcurrentselectedcandidateandselectionmetadata retained forever. No publicOOSaccess canoccur without committedselection event.

## Criteria-change lineage and claim limits

For NEW selection revisions, compare selection_criteria with the latest earlier committed selection in the same experiment/hypothesis (highest lifecycle seq; historical replay uses only its earlier prefix). If criteria differ, selected_candidate_id must differ and its validated earlier-committed parent chain must reach the previous selected_candidate_id. Otherwise raise exactly `changed selection criteria require a new candidate revision with prior selection lineage`. Run after chronology and before validation access proof. Exact original recapture returns before this current gate. Test actual SQLite rejection of changed criteria with same selected candidate or unrelated replacement, acceptance of linked new candidate with unseen holdout, and preserved prior selection. This implements ST-02 without adding candidate fields or inventing optimizer results.

The declared considered list and N/index set validate the declared trial budget only. They cannot prove all human-considered alternatives were recorded; unlogged/manual alternatives remain unverified (Phase19 multiple-testing controls are outside scope). Criteria text is an attributed declaration, not proof of actual optimization or selection outcomes. All claimed validation proof is logged committed access to the exact range for each declared considered candidate.

## Exact persisted payloads and replay

Selection payload EXACT keys: contract_version,rule_id,document,candidate_bindings,selection_memberships,holdout_membership. document is the exact validated finalselection document above, with integerpositions typedhex (oosbounds and nestedvalidationstart/end), tupleconsidered canonicalizedlist. candidate_bindings ordered list matching consideredids; each exact {candidate_id,candidate_payload}, candidate_payload parsed exact immutablecanonicalcandidate JSON (alreadytypedcash/IS/trialnumbers), binding actualparams/code/seed/artifacts/trial/ISreferences without caller-overrides. selection_memberships orderedlist one per candidateIS, then commonvalidation ifused, each exact {role,candidate_id,input_id,start_ts,end_ts,members}; role='is'/'validation', candidate_id null onlycommonvalidation. holdout_membership exact {input_id,start_ts,end_ts,members}. Bounds typedhexints. No rawOHLCV/recipe leaked in these metadata structures. Candidate/input IDs reference internalsourceevents and are integrity-replayed.

Each members value is a chronological unique list of fixed6elementarrays [venue,symbol,timeframe,source_family,typed(ts),typed(close_ts)]. Exact acceptedstrings and {'kind':'int','value':hex(n)} clockobjects; no alternatives/objectaliases/encodedstringtuplehash. Computed from reproducedcoveredrows, neveraccepted from publicdocument. Every membership derives onlyexplicitclosemembers; completecoverage checked beforecanonicalization. Duplicate subjectkeys cannot be masked by revisions.

Inspection payload EXACT keys: contract_version,rule_id,access_id,action,access_status,actor,declared_at_ts,note,input_id,start_ts,end_ts,source_watermark,members,candidate_id,selection_id. Versions research-inspection-v1/phase18-temporal-v1. access_id serveruuid4.hex32lowerhex. action validation/oos/external. access_status first_access/repeat_access/external_declaration. Allnumbers (bounds, watermark, nonnullclaimedtime) exacttypedint; strings/null unchanged. Forvalidation candidate_id required, selection_id null; foroos selection_id required,candidate_id null; forexternal bothnull, note required and claimedtime optional. Softwareactions note and declaredtime null. Actorvalidnonemptytext. No wirecaller access_status/UUID/watermark/members field accepted; server derivesall.

Repeat scope: prior softwareinspection with sameaction and (validation: candidate_id,input_id,start,end; oos:selection_id). Actor DOESNOT reset scope. First if none earliercommittedmatching, repeatotherwise; everycall stilldistinctuuid/event. external alwaysexternal_declaration, never claimsindependentaccess. These labels describe loggedaccess only, not independentstatisticalevaluation/reproductionresult. No actualresultpublished in k.

Lifecycle replay on sameconnection: parseexactcanonicalJSON with duplicatekey/noncanonicaltypedhex rejection; payloadhash/kind and indexedcolumns match; exactpayloadkeysets; UUIDformat/conditionalnulls/actions/status checked. Selection replay replayscandidate/inputevents, recomputesallbindings/memberships/fullcanonicalpayload and requiresbyteequality; inspection replay replaysreferences and recomputessubjectmembership. Require referencedsourceevents seq<=persistedsource_watermark forinspection; selectedselection lifecycle seq<inspectionseq. Recomputefirst/repeatstatus against ONLY earlierinspectionseq events; no self/later/cyclicreferences. Selectionvalidationproof/contamination reconstructed against ONLY earlierlifecycleevents, so laterinspectioncannot invalidate anoriginallegitimatefreeze. Never truststoredmembers withoutreproduction or indexedrevision withoutdecodedagreement. Integrityfailure exactexisting `stored research event failed integrity validation`; no hash/UUID authenticatesmaliciousSQLiteowner.

Freeze idempotence: validatepublicdocument and deriveexactbindings/memberships via immutablecandidate/source replay; lookup sameexperiment/hypothesis/revision. If originalpayload exactlyequalsnewderivedpayload, replayoriginalagainstits ownhistoricalseq andreturnoriginalBEFORE applying currentinspection checks. Changedpayload under samerevision raisesrevisionconflict. NEWrevision applies fullcurrentbarrier beforeinsert. This prevents genuineexactrecapture beingblocked bylaterinspection while forbidding after-the-factchangedselection. No idempotence shortcut trusting callerhash or skippingoriginalintegrity.

## Contamination subject and access semantics

Capturedinputs syntheticBTCcontinuousdailyonly. Subjectkey explicitly (venue,symbol,timeframe,source_family,ts,close_ts), source_family='controlled-fixture:controlled-daily-linear-v1'. Intkeys exact. Ignore snapshotID, recipehash, revisionID, payloadprice andsourceanchor differences for contaminationmatching WITHINthisfamily: sharedrealbar-clockobservations across alternate syntheticrecipes are conservativelytreatedpreviouslyinspected. This restricts, never certifiesunseenmarkettruth. No unknownreal-sourcemapping/default accepted. Membership is finite actualcompleteclosememberkeys, not merelyintervalhash. A renamednewrevisionorpricechange cannot reset sameclocks' inspection. Inspect allledgeractors/experiments: newexperimentdoesnoterase sameholdoutaccess.

Validationaccess: replaycandidateexisting, inputfixturefullcoverage; candidateISend<=validationstart; initialcandidate must predate every earlierexternal/oosinspection of requestedvalidationkeys (candidate.seq<=watermark), else reject. Do not prohibit repeatedvalidationaccess for samefrozencandidate; softwarevalidationrecord sourcewatermarkprovesexistingfreeze. Requestedvalidation keys must not overlap ANYregisteredselectionOOSkeys, and must not overlap anyprioroos/externalinspectionkeys: OOS cannot silentlybecomevalidation in this bounded access path. SC15 remains supported: a NEWcandidate_revision may explicitly declare previouslyinspectedOOSobservations as its NEW IS range/input (j capture permits this), retainingparentlineage, and then freeze NEWfinalselection with a genuinelyuninspected disjointholdout. Priorresults remainunchanged and oldholdout is nowdeclareddevelopmentdata, neverindependentfinalevidence. This reclassification doesnot require silentvalidationreuse or eraseledgerhistory; commonvalidation ifused must satisfy this boundedgate. A newhash/revision cannot reuseoldholdout as finalOOS.

OOSaccess: replayvalidselection, resolve exactholdoutinput/range/memberkeys, append inspection THENreturnONLYthoseobservations. Firstaccessfrozenbeforeinspection by transactionexistence. Repeatedsame selection permits reproduction/inspection, distinctevents; no independenttrialclaim. Newselection afteranysuchaccessrejects same/overlappingholdout. Access is not executionreservation/result and cannot claimcompletedOOS.

Externalinspection: validatescapturesource/fullcoverage, actor+note explicitvalidtext, declared_at integerexcludingboolorNone. Appends regardlesswhetherselectionexists, never blocksrecording truthfulcontamination. Mayrecordearlierclaimedtime; applications cannot proveoutsidebehavior. Does not returnobservations. Existing frozenresults/selections unaffected; laterselectionnewunseenholdoutrequired. Unknownunreportedinspection/predictablesyntheticprices remainunverified.

## 3. Important Limitations

- A green test suite does not prove absence of future-bar influence.
- A self-consistent equity reconstruction is not an independent external account verification.
- Bar-close timestamps do not by themselves eliminate same-bar execution bias.
- Statistical metrics are not evidence of strategy validity until the research-design controls are implemented.

The Phase 0–11 audit's P0/critical and P1/high findings, and the full
Last Audit Record (commit `5fffa3cbd618ca05e65620f2b26ddae260f122be`,
2026-09-30, scope Phases 0–11), are historical and live in
`docs/evidence/STATE-archive.md`.

A task may transition only through:

```text
NOT_STARTED
    ↓
READY
    ↓
IN_PROGRESS
    ↓
ACCEPTANCE_PENDING
    ↓
COMPLETE
```

Failure returns the task to `IN_PROGRESS` or `BLOCKED`.

A phase cannot become `COMPLETE` until:

1. every task is complete;
2. required tests exist and test the specified behavior;
3. whole-tree acceptance passes;
4. no unapproved scope changes remain;
5. required probe/approval rules were followed;
6. the reviewer accepts the work;
7. this file is updated with evidence.

No agent may skip a state transition merely because the change appears small.

---

## 7. Required Evidence Per Completed Task

Record:

- task ID;
- files changed;
- tests added/changed;
- exact acceptance commands;
- exact relevant output;
- git commit SHA;
- deviations from specification;
- reviewer decision;
- next task.

Do not record “done” as the only evidence.

---

## 8. Conflict Protocol

If any of the following disagree:

- `STATE.md`;
- `PROJECT.md`;
- `docs/ai/WORKFLOW.md`;
- `docs/ai/REVIEWER.md`;
- repository code;
- tests;
- git history;
- a third-party API probe;

STOP.

Report:

```text
STATE CONFLICT

Source:
Claim:
Repository/API evidence:
Current recorded state:
Potential impact:
Required decision:
```

Do not silently choose which source is “probably right.”

---

## 9. Update Rule

`STATE.md` is intentionally short and mutable.

It must be updated whenever a task or phase changes state.

Do not copy the complete roadmap into this file. The permanent roadmap belongs in `PROJECT.md`.

Do not put implementation details here unless they are necessary to describe current state or a blocker.
